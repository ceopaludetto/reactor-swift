# Swift Reactor

Recreating [Project Reactor](https://projectreactor.io/) on Swift just for fun

At first I've followed this [awesome presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdSZ6mOQDcY) about reactive-streams specification

Then I've started to recreate my own publishers, operators and TCK

This project is also a monorepo with shared dependencies between each other

## Get Started

- You need swift 5.9 installed on your system
- You may want to install [apple-swift-format](https://github.com/apple/swift-format) as well to properly format the code

## VSCode

You will need these extensions:

- [Swift](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sswg.swift-lang)
- [Apple SwiftFormat](https://github.com/vknabel/vscode-apple-swift-format)
